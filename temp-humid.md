There’s tons of 3D printed case examples for the Wemos D1 Mini type boards. 
One thing is that while the temp sensor has a small screw hole for mounting, the controller board itself does not. At least not without drilling thru the PCB. So might need to get creative with how to attach it to a case, etc.

A few example cases from one of the tutorials: https://peyanski.com/diy-temperature-sensor-for-home-assistant/#3D_Printed_enclosurebox
